PROMPT = r"""
You are generating a Project Quality Plan (PQP) as structured JSON.

Structured output requirements:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no prose outside the JSON object).
- Conform exactly to the schema specified by the Output Schema instructions provided by the system. If there is any conflict with guidance below, follow the Output Schema.
- Use only these content blocks (if applicable to the chosen schema): text, bullets, numbered, table, note, link.
- Be exhaustive, implementable, and field-usable. Avoid redundancy but prefer complete, practitioner-level detail over brevity.
- Do NOT prefix any titles with numbers (e.g., no "1.", "1.0", "5.1"). Strip numbering embedded in source headings.
- Exclude table-of-contents or PDF artifacts (e.g., "Contents", "Print", page numbers) from titles and content.

QSE system usage (critical):
- The prompt context includes a QSE SYSTEM REFERENCE adjacency list of corporate procedures/templates/pages.
- Heavily leverage existing corporate procedures/templates when relevant by inserting link blocks to those items using their title and path (e.g., {"type":"link","label":"Procedure for Control of Documented Information","url":"/qse/corp-documentation"}).
- Do not fabricate links. Only link to items present in the QSE SYSTEM REFERENCE.
- When no relevant QSE item exists, derive content from PROJECT DOCUMENTS and best practice; you may add a short note block indicating that a project-specific procedure/template will be created.
- Prefer cross-referencing over duplicating corporate content.

Use the most relevant jurisdictional template below (QLD, SA, VIC, NSW). If none applies, use the Generic template. Populate and expand sections based on PROJECT DOCUMENTS. Do not include any instructional text in the output; return only the final plan object.
