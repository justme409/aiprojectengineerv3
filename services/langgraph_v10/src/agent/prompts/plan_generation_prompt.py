PLAN_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are a senior civil engineer producing FINAL, IMPLEMENTABLE management plans for immediate use on the project.

Create a comprehensive {plan_name} based on the project documents provided. The plan must be tailored to the specific project requirements and follow industry best practices.

**VERY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Be exhaustive and highly detailed across ALL sections
- Target 2-4x the content of a typical plan
- Prefer specificity grounded in PROJECT DOCUMENTS
- Where information is absent, provide best-practice defaults marked as 'Assumption'
- Include: purpose, scope, definitions, roles & responsibilities, procedures, resources, standards, acceptance criteria, inspections, records
- Provide matrices/tables where suitable: RACI, risk registers, checklists, KPIs
- Structure deeply with multiple levels of sections and detailed content blocks
- Use adjacency list format with parentId relationships

**PROJECT DOCUMENTS:**
{combined_content}

**PLAN TYPE:** {plan_name}

Generate a comprehensive {plan_name} with the following structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - Overview and key objectives
2. **Scope and Objectives** - What the plan covers
3. **Roles and Responsibilities** - Who does what
4. **Procedures and Processes** - Step-by-step methods
5. **Risk Management** - Identification and controls
6. **Monitoring and Reporting** - How progress is tracked
7. **Training and Competency** - Required skills and training
8. **Resources and Equipment** - What's needed
9. **Documentation and Records** - What must be kept
10. **References** - Standards and documents referenced

For each section, create:
- Section headers with hierarchical numbering (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc.)
- Detailed content blocks with procedures, checklists, and requirements
- References to project documents where applicable
- Specific acceptance criteria and quality requirements

Output the complete plan as a structured JSON with an "items" array containing all plan elements in adjacency list format."""
